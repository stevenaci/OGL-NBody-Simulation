## OGL-NBody-Simulation
![1](https://github.com/stevenaci/OGL-NBody-Simulation/blob/master/Game/screenshots/2.png)

An NBody simulation, using OpenGL, GLU and Bullet 3D physics.

Edit: Some of these techniques are deprecated for modern GL, such as using draw lists, and using GLEW in general as a windowing system!
Still useful as a historic account of openGL! Stay tuned for a much more advanced 3d engine I am building, centered around massive amounts of objects in a world space.
